## About Me 

I am a **Ph.D. student** in the Education Data Science program at Stanford University, primarily advised by Professor [**Daniel McFarland**](https://profiles.stanford.edu/daniel-mcfarland) in the [**MIMIR Knowledge Creation Lab**](https://mimir.stanford.edu). I also work closely with Professor [**Victor R. Lee**](https://profiles.stanford.edu/victorlee) in the [**Data Interactions & STEM Teaching and Learning Lab (DISTAL)**](https://distal.stanford.edu). 

## Research Interests

I use **computational methods** — including causal inference, natural language processing, and social network analysis — to model how innovations and ideas emerge, spread, and take root across social systems. I am particularly interested in: 

- **Knowledge Diffusion**: how ideas are produced, selected, and diffused through scholarly communication and peer review
- **Innovation and Technology Adoption**: how organizations and social systems respond to and integrate emerging technologies
- **AI in Education**: how AI-empowered tools are adopted and used in secondary education
