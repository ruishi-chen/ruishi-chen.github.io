I am a PhD student in Education Data Science at Stanford University, specializing in Social Network Methods, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. My research focuses on incorporating social network methods with natural language processing to understand social interactions and understanding information diffusion in the sciences, education, and digital media.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a Sociology minor from Emory University, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude with Phi Beta Kappa honors. I have extensive experience in research, teaching, and professional development across multiple domains including educational technology, AI in education, and social network analysis.

## Current Research

I am currently working on several research projects at Stanford:

- **Support Novice Teachers in Generating Misconception Look-fors with LLMs** - Architecting multi-agent AI simulation leveraging OpenAI API GPT-4o, RAG, and few-shot prompting
- **Cheating in the Age of Generative AI (ChAI)** - Designing and testing survey items to capture responses to AI-powered technology
- **Factors Influencing Desk Rejection in Peer Review** - Developing advanced NLP pipelines and analyzing large-scale knowledge networks

## Research Interests

My research interests include:
- Incorporating social network methods with natural language processing to understand social interactions
- Understanding information diffusion in the sciences, education, and digital media
- Educational technology and AI applications in learning environments
- Machine learning applications in educational data science
