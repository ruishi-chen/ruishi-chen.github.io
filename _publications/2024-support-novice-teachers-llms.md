This project architects a multi-agent AI simulation leveraging OpenAI API GPT-4o, RAG, and few-shot prompting, enabling users to interact with natural language prompts and dynamically monitor agents' reflection and thought process. The system is built with components using HTML5, JavaScript to create real-time dashboards and interactive features.
