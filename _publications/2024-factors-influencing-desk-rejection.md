This project develops an advanced NLP pipeline processing 180K+ consultation emails, leveraging RoBERTa for epistemic value identification (achieving 82% accuracy) and stance detection using VADER for Sentiment Analysis. The research architects and analyzes large-scale knowledge networks (125K+ nodes) using PageRank for influence measurements, centrality metrics for key author identification, and Node2vec for relationship mapping. Additionally, it develops Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression to quantify the effects of evaluation metrics and applies a mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards model to the temporal dynamics in decision-making processes.
