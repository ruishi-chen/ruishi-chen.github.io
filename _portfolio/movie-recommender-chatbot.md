**Duration:** January 2023 – March 2024  
**Location:** Stanford, CA  
**Course Instructor:** Professor Daniel Jurafsky (Course Grade: A+)

## Project Overview
Built a comprehensive Python-based chatbot that recommends movies based on user sentiments and arbitrary input using different methods including Genial Understander System (GUS), GPT 3.5 prompting, and LLM programming.

## Key Features
* **Multi-Method Approach**: Implemented three different recommendation algorithms
  - Genial Understander System (GUS)
  - GPT 3.5 prompting integration
  - Large Language Model programming
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced sentiment processing for personalized recommendations
* **User Interaction**: Natural language processing for arbitrary user input
* **Python Implementation**: Full-stack development in Python

## Technical Skills Applied
* Natural Language Processing
* Sentiment Analysis
* Large Language Models (LLMs)
* GPT API Integration
* Python Programming
* Chatbot Development
* Machine Learning

## Impact
This project demonstrates the integration of multiple AI approaches to create a sophisticated recommendation system that can understand and respond to natural language queries about movie preferences.
