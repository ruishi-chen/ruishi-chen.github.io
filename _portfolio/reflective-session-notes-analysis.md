**Duration:** January 2024 – March 2024  
**Location:** Stanford, CA  
**Course Instructor:** Professor Sanne Smith

## Project Overview
Processed and cleaned a dataset of 18,911 session notes with NLTK and TextBlob to analyze content structures and themes. Developed an expanded lexicons based on LIWC for growth mindset and knowledge acquisition to label and analyze the content of session notes to reflect the students' growth from tutoring sessions according to mentors' noting.

## Key Achievements
